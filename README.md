# Running Locally

To run this program locally, first install Python 3.9+ and Git. Then install Pytorch 10.1+ and all the other dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, run the full version (no audio length restrictions) of the app:
```
python app-full.py
```

You can also run the CLI interface, which is similar to Whisper's own CLI but also supports the following additional arguments:
```
python cli.py \
[--vad {none,silero-vad,silero-vad-skip-gaps,silero-vad-expand-into-gaps,periodic-vad}] \
[--vad_merge_window VAD_MERGE_WINDOW] \
[--vad_max_merge_size VAD_MAX_MERGE_SIZE] \
[--vad_padding VAD_PADDING] \
[--vad_prompt_window VAD_PROMPT_WINDOW]
[--vad_parallel_devices COMMA_DELIMITED_DEVICES]
```
In addition, you may also use URL's in addition to file paths as input.
```
python cli.py --model large --vad silero-vad --language Japanese "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cICErqqRSM"
```

## Parallel Execution

You can also run both the Web-UI or the CLI on multiple GPUs in parallel, using the `vad_parallel_devices` option. This takes a comma-delimited list of 
device IDs (0, 1, etc.) that Whisper should be distributed to and run on concurrently:
```
python cli.py --model large --vad silero-vad --language Japanese --vad_parallel_devices 0,1 "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cICErqqRSM"
```

Note that this requires a VAD to function properly, otherwise only the first GPU will be used. Though you could use `period-vad` to avoid taking the hit
of running Silero-Vad, at a slight cost to accuracy.

This is achieved by creating N child processes (where N is the number of selected devices), where Whisper is run concurrently. In `app.py`, you can also 
set the `vad_process_timeout` option, which configures the number of seconds until a process is killed due to inactivity, freeing RAM and video memory. 
The default value is 30 minutes.

```
python app.py --input_audio_max_duration -1 --vad_parallel_devices 0,1 --vad_process_timeout 3600
```

You may also use `vad_process_timeout` with a single device (`--vad_parallel_devices 0`), if you prefer to free video memory after a period of time.

# Docker

To run it in Docker, first install Docker and optionally the NVIDIA Container Toolkit in order to use the GPU. Then 
check out this repository and build an image:
```
sudo docker build -t whisper-webui:1 .
```

You can then start the WebUI with GPU support like so:
```
sudo docker run -d --gpus=all -p 7860:7860 whisper-webui:1
```

Leave out "--gpus=all" if you don't have access to a GPU with enough memory, and are fine with running it on the CPU only:
```
sudo docker run -d -p 7860:7860 whisper-webui:1
```

## Caching

Note that the models themselves are currently not included in the Docker images, and will be downloaded on the demand.
To avoid this, bind the directory /root/.cache/whisper to some directory on the host (for instance /home/administrator/.cache/whisper), where you can (optionally) 
prepopulate the directory with the different Whisper models. 
```
sudo docker run -d --gpus=all -p 7860:7860 --mount type=bind,source=/home/administrator/.cache/whisper,target=/root/.cache/whisper whisper-webui:1
```
