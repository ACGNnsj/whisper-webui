# Running Locally

To run this program locally, first install Python 3.9+ and Git. Then install Pytorch 10.1+ and all the other dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, run the full version (no audio length restrictions) of the app:
```
python app-full.py
```

# Docker

To run it in Docker, first install Docker and optionally the NVIDIA Container Toolkit in order to use the GPU. Then 
check out this repository and build an image:
```
sudo docker build -t whisper-webui:1 .
```

You can then start the WebUI with GPU support like so:
```
sudo docker run -d --gpus=all -p 7860:7860 whisper-webui:1
```

Leave out "--gpus=all" if you don't have access to a GPU with enough memory, and are fine with running it on the CPU only:
```
sudo docker run -d -p 7860:7860 whisper-webui:1
```

## Caching

Note that the models themselves are currently not included in the Docker images, and will be downloaded on the demand.
To avoid this, bind the directory /root/.cache/whisper to some directory on the host, where you can (optionally) 
prepopulate the directory with the different Whisper models.
